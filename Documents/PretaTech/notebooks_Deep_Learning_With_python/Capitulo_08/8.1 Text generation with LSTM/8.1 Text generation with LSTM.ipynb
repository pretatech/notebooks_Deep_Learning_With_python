    "## 8.1 Geração de texto com LSTM\n",
    "\n",
    "> Use LSTM para gerar texto\n",
    "\n",
    "Alguém já disse: “gerar dados sequenciais é o mais próximo que os computadores chegam de sonhar.” É muito atraente permitir que os computadores gerem sequências. Tomaremos a geração de texto como exemplo para discutir como usar redes neurais recorrentes para gerar dados de sequência. Essa tecnologia também pode ser usada para geração de música, síntese de voz, geração de diálogo de chatbot e até mesmo escrita de roteiro de filme.\n",
    "\n",
    "Na verdade, o algoritmo LSTM com o qual estamos familiarizados foi usado para gerar texto caractere por caractere quando foi desenvolvido pela primeira vez.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Sequência de geração de dados\n",
    "\n",
    "O método geral de geração de sequências com aprendizado profundo é treinar uma rede (geralmente RNN ou CNN), inserir o Token anterior e prever o próximo Token na sequência.\n",
    "\n",
    "A terminologia é um pouco: dado o Token anterior, a rede que pode modelar a probabilidade do próximo Token é chamada de \"modelo de linguagem\". O modelo de linguagem pode capturar a estrutura estatística da linguagem - \"espaço latente\". Treine um modelo de linguagem, insira a string de texto inicial (chamada de \"dados de condicionamento\") e faça uma amostra do modelo de linguagem para gerar um novo token, adicione o novo token aos dados condicionais, insira-o novamente e repita o processo Você pode gerar sequências de qualquer comprimento.\n",
    "\n",
    "Vamos começar com um exemplo simples: use uma camada LSTM, insira uma string de N caracteres do corpus do texto e treine o modelo para gerar o N + 1 º caractere. A saída do modelo é fazer softmax e obter a distribuição de probabilidade do próximo caractere em todos os caracteres possíveis. Este modelo é chamado de \"modelo de linguagem neural de nível de caractere\".\n",
    "\n",
    "### Estratégia de amostragem\n",
    "\n",
    "Ao usar um modelo de linguagem neural em nível de caractere para gerar texto, a questão mais importante é como selecionar o próximo caractere. Aqui estão alguns métodos comuns:\n",
    "\n",
    "Amostragem -Greedy: sempre selecione o próximo personagem com a maior probabilidade. É provável que esse método obtenha strings repetitivas e previsíveis, e o significado pode não ser consistente. (Associação de método de entrada)\n",
    "- Amostragem aleatória pura: desenhe o próximo personagem de uma distribuição de probabilidade uniforme, onde cada personagem tem a mesma probabilidade. Essa aleatoriedade é muito alta e quase nenhum conteúdo interessante é gerado. (É uma combinação de caracteres de saída aleatórios)\n",
    "-Amostragem estocástica: De acordo com os resultados do modelo de linguagem, se a probabilidade do próximo caractere ser e é 0,3, então você tem 30% de probabilidade de escolhê-lo. Existe um pouco de aleatoriedade, o que torna o conteúdo gerado mais ~~ aleatório ~~ rico em variedade, mas não completamente aleatório, a saída pode ser mais interessante.\n",
    "\n",
    "A amostragem aleatória parece boa e criativa, mas há um problema de que é impossível controlar a magnitude da aleatoriedade: quanto maior a aleatoriedade, mais criativa, mas a saída pode ser aleatória; quanto menor a aleatoriedade, mais próximo das palavras e frases reais, mas também Rígido e previsível.\n",
    "\n",
    "Para controlar a aleatoriedade durante o processo de amostragem, é introduzido um parâmetro: \"softmax temperature\" (softmax temperature), usado para representar a entropia da distribuição de probabilidade de amostragem, ou seja, quão inesperado ou previsível será o próximo caractere selecionado:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Temperatura mais alta: uma distribuição de amostragem com maior entropia gerará dados mais inesperados e não estruturados;\n",
    "- Menor temperatura: Correspondendo a menos aleatoriedade, dados mais previsíveis serão gerados.\n",
    "\n",
    "A implementação específica é ponderar novamente a saída softmax do modelo dado o valor da temperatura para obter uma nova distribuição de probabilidade:"
